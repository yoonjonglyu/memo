## 🔹 Service Concept

MemoFlow aims for 'lightness,' distinguishing itself from heavy calendars or bloated note-taking apps.

- **Short-term Focus**: Perfect for managing volatile schedules that you record and delete quickly.
- **Tetris Design**: A minimalist UI concept that reduces visual fatigue with a clean, block-style interface.
- **Offline First**: Record instantly without a network connection using `@capacitor/filesystem` and `localStorage`, and sync when online.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Platform Support

- **Mobile**: Native experience on Android (powered by Capacitor 8).
- **Desktop**: Standalone software for Windows (powered by Electron 23) and PWA support.
- **Web**: Immediate access and usage through any modern web browser.

### 2. Smart Sync & Backup

- **Google Drive Sync**: Secure data synchronization and continuity using your personal Google Drive—no separate server required.
- **Flexible Export/Import**: Export data in JSON, Markdown, or HTML formats, and restore via JSON import.

### 3. Modern UI/UX & Quality

- **Tailwind CSS 4.0**: High-performance styling with the latest engine and a minimalist "Tetris-inspired" design.
- **Storybook 8**: UI reliability ensured through component documentation and Interaction Testing (Play functions).
- **MSW**: Robust verification of network scenarios using Mock Service Worker for API mocking.
